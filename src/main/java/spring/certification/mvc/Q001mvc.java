 * Question 001:<br>
 * MVC is an abbreviation for a design pattern.<br>
 * What does it stand for and what is the idea behind it?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * <b>MVC</b> stands for Model-View-Controller. The main idea is to separate different layers of a web-application,
 * which makes it possible to reuse controllers and models with different views.<br>
 * - Model - business data of an application<br>
 * - View - model presented to the user in desired format<br>
 * - Controller - users' requests handler, interacts with the model (usually via service layer) and directs users
 * to the appropriate view<br>
