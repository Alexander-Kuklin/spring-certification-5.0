 * Question 020:<br>
 * Why are controllers testable artifacts?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Spring Mvc framework allows to define a web-controller without extending any base
 * class or implement any predefined interface, thus web-controllers are plain java-objects.<br>
 * It's easy to create an instance of such class and test it in isolation.<br>
 * Moreover Spring Mvc framework offers full mock support for Servlet API.
