 * Question 004:<br>
 * Is the DispatcherServlet instantiated via an application context?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * DispatcherServlet is instatiated by a servlet container. Each dispatcher servlet has its own context
 * which is instatiated along with each servlet. In particular such instantiation pattern is implemented
 * by {@link AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer#registerDispatcherServlet} method. This initializer
 * is also responsible for root application context bootstrapping which is shared among all servlet registered
 * within the application.<br>
