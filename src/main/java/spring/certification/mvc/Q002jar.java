 * Question 002:<br>
 * Do you need spring-mvc.jar in your classpath or is it part of spring-core?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Spring Web MVC is a separate module of Spring Framework which is packaged into a separate jar file, it's not a part
 * of Spring IoC module (spring-core). On the contrary Spring Web MVC module has a dependency on Spring IoC.<br>
