 * Question 002:<br>
 * What type of tests typically use Spring?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Most of the time Spring Framework is used to test <b>integration</b> between developed code and Spring Framework.<br>
 * Those kind of tests are called <b>integration tests</b>. Main goals to use Spring Framework in tests are the following:<br>
 * - to manage Spring IoC container caching between tests<br>
 * - to provide Dependency Injection of test fixture instances<br>
 * - to provide transaction management appropriate to integration testing<br>
 * - to supply Spring-specific base classes that assist developers in writing integration tests<br>
