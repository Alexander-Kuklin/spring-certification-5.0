 * What are safe REST operations?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Safe REST operations are the operations which <b>do not modify</b> resource or more specifically do not modify
 * resource representation (they can actually change some data on the server side, e.g. requests number). Safe operations
 * are related to the following HTTP methods:<br>
 * - GET<br>
 * - HEAD<br>
 * - OPTIONS<br>
 * - TRACE<br>
