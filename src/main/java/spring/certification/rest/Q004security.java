 * Question 004:<br>
 * Is REST secure?<br>
 * What can you do to secure it?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * REST architectural style is about designing scalable, distributed, decoupled systems, it is not about creating
 * secure systems. Thus additional considerations have to be made while creating RESTful services. To utilize
 * additional layer of security HTTPs protocol might be used. Also Spring framework offers web-layer and service-layer
 * security mechanisms.<br>
