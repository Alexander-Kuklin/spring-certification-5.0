 * Question 001:
 * What is dependency injection and what are the advantages?
 * <p>
 * Answer:
 * <b>Dependency injection</b> is a design pattern which implements <b>Inversion of Control (IoC)</b> design principle,
 * whereby objects only define their dependencies letting some other code to <b>inject</b> those dependencies during
 * object creation. That is why this process is called an inversion: an object doesn't control instantiation of its
 * dependencies on its own.
 * <p>
 * There are several dependency <b>injection types</b>:<br>
 * 1. Constructor injection - dependencies are provided through a constructor<br>
 * 2. Setter injection - dependencies are provided through an exposed setter method<br>
 * 3. Interface injection - dependencies are provided through an exposed setter method of implemented interface<br>
 * <p>
 * Dependency injection <b>advantages</b> are the following:<br>
 * 1. Code is cleaner (object configuration details are externalized)<br>
 * 2. Decoupling decreases between an object and its dependencies<br>
 * 3. Code is easier to test using stubs or mocks<br>
 * 4. Facilitating single responsibility principle
 * <p>
 * Dependency injection <b>disadvantages</b> are the following:<br>
 * 1. Increased number of classes<br>
 * 2. Creation of unnecessary interfaces<br>
 * <p>
 * Examples of mentioned terms:<br>
 * {@link Question001.WithoutInjector} - an example which doesn't utilize Dependency Injection design pattern.<br>
 * {@link Question001.WithInjector} - an example which utilizes Dependency Injection design pattern.<br>
 * {@link DependencyInjectionTypes#injectThroughConstructor()} - an example of injecting dependencies through
 * constructor.<br>
 * {@link DependencyInjectionTypes#injectThroughSetter()} - an example of injecting dependencies through setter.<br>
 * {@link DependencyInjectionTypes#injectThroughInterface()} - an example of injecting dependencies through setter
 * of implemented interface.<br>
