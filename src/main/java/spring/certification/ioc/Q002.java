/**
 * Spring v5.0 Professional Certification.
 * <p>
 * Question 002:<br>
 * What is a pattern?<br>
 * What is an anti-pattern?<br>
 * Is dependency injection a pattern?
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Design pattern is a typical solution to commonly occurring problem in software design which is considered a good
 * programming practice. <b>Singleton</b> is an example of a design pattern which is also widely used by Spring
 * framework.
 * <p>
 * Anti-pattern is the opposite - typical solution that is considered a bad programming practice because it's usually
 * ineffective and counterproductive. <b>God object</b> is well known object-oriented anti-pattern.
 * <p>
 * Dependency injection is a design pattern which makes code look cleaner, decreases decoupling between objects,
 * makes code easier to test. For more information about dependency injection design pattern look at {@link Q001}.
 * <p>
 * Examples of mentioned terms:<br>
 * {@link Q002.DesignPattern} - an example of good coding practice (design pattern).<br>
 * {@link Q002.AntiPattern} - an example of bad coding practice (anti-pattern).<br>
 * {@link Q001} - discusses dependency injection design pattern in greater details.
