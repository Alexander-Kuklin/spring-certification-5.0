 * 1. Additional information related to <b>Inversion of Control</b> design principle.
 * <p>
 * There's also another flavour of Inversion of Control design pattern which is called <b>Dependency Lookup</b>.
 * This kind of IoC implementation implies that dependent object retrieves required components (collaborators) from
 * the IoC container which manages those components by itself. Though this kind of design pattern is easier to
 * implement, it clutters up application with wiring code.
 * <p>
 * Examples of mentioned terms:
 * {@link DependencyLookup.DependencyLookUp} - simplistic example of <b>Dependency Lookup</b> design pattern.
