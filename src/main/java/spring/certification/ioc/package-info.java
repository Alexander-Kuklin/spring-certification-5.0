 * called?<br>
 * 19.3. How else can you define an initialization or destruction method for a Spring bean?<br>
 * 20. What does component-scanning do?<br>
 * 21. What is the behavior of the annotation @Autowired with regards to field injection, constructor injection and
 * method injection?<br>
 * 22. What do you have to do, if you would like to inject something into a private field? Ho does  this impact
 * testing?<br>
 * 23. How does the @Qualifier annotation complement the use of @Autowired?<br>

 * 31. Can you use @Component together with @Profile? {@link spring.certification.ioc.Q031 link}<br>
 * 32. How many profiles can you have? {@link spring.certification.ioc.Q032 link}<br>
