/**
 * Spring v5.0 Professional Certification.
 * <p>
 * Question 022:<br>
 * What is a PersistenceContext and what is an EntityManager. What is the relationship between both?<br>
 * Why do you need the @Entity annotation. Where can it be placed?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * <b>PersistenceContext</b> is a set of cached entity instances. Within persistence context entities and their lifecycle
 * are managed. Set of entities (actually a set of related classes) is uniquely identified by a persistence unit
 * (a database).<br>
 * An <b>EntityManager</b> is essentially an API to access <b>PersistenceContext</b>. Each <b>EntityManager</b> is
 * associated with a <b>PersistenceContext</b>.<br>
 * <p>
 * {@link Entity} annotation can be applied at a <b>class-level</b> only. Only annotated class is considered to be
 * an <b>entity-class</b> (according to JPA specification) and is used to be mapped to a database record.<br>
