 * Question 008:<br>
 * What is the difference between an embedded container and a WAR?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Embedded container allows to create self-sufficient web applications (packaged in a jar file).
 * WAR file is essentially the same jar file with specific hierarchical directory structure, which should
 * be deployed on a standalone web container. It's possible to construct Spring Boot application in any
 * of those ways.<br>
