 * In general the main Spring Boot advantage is that it easies configuration of Spring-based applications:<br>
 * - usage of spring-boot-starter jars<br>
 * - beans autoconfiguration<br>
 * - possibility to create single jar for the entire web-application<br>
 * - easy customization of Spring Boot defaults<br>
 * Extra:<br>
 * Below is an excerpt taken from documentation about Spring Boot advantages:<br>
 * - Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.<br>
 * - Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.<br>
 * - Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers,
 * security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).<br>
 * - Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.<br>
