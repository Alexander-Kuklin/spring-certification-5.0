 * Question 005:<br>
 * What things affect what Spring Boot sets up?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * {@link Conditional} annotation along with {@link Condition} interface offer infinite
 * possibilities to define what can actually affect Spring Boot autoconfiguration (it is
 * only limited by the Java language itself). The most basic cases, which are used almost
 * by every autoconfiguration Spring Boot class, are listed in the {@link Q004autoconfiguration autoconfiguration question}.<br>
