 * Question 001:<br>
 * What are authentication and authorization? Which must come first?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Security turns around two core concepts: authentication and authorization.<br>
 * <b>Authentication</b> is an identification process which verifies that a user is who he claims to be.<br>
 * <b>Authorization</b> is a process of granting or denying an access to a requested resource for previously authenticated user.<br>
 * Authorization process might be applied only to previously authenticated user, thus authentication precedes authorization.<br>
