 * Question 014:<br>
 * How are method security annotations implemented?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Method security annotations are implemented using AOP proxies. AOP proxy is a dynamically created
 * object which wraps target object and intercepts method invocation. Please refer to the AOP section
 * for explanation of this {@link CrossCuttingSolution approach} and its {@link ProxyLimitations limitations}.<br>
